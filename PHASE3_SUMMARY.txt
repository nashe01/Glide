- Real-time Firebase listeners with proper error handling
- Distance calculations using Haversine formula
- Location permission handling and GPS integration
- SharedPreferences for local data persistence

WORKFLOW SEQUENCE
=================

Commuter Side (HomeCommuterActivity):
1. Set destination by long-pressing on map or using search (future)
2. View nearby available drivers as markers on map
3. Click driver marker to see detailed information
4. Automatically send ride request to selected driver
5. Wait for driver response with real-time status updates
6. Handle accepted/declined responses with appropriate actions

Driver Side (DashboardDriverActivity):
1. Toggle availability status (online/offline) with visual feedback
2. Receive incoming ride request notifications in real-time
3. View detailed request information (pickup, destination, distance)
4. Accept or decline ride request with immediate status updates
5. Automatic Firebase updates for all status changes

FIREBASE INTEGRATION DETAILS
============================

Database URL: https://glide-77761-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/

Enhanced Data Structure:
- rideRequests: {rideId: {commuterId, driverId, pickupLocation, destination, status, timestamp}}
- drivers: {driverId: {name, phone, currentLocation, rating, completedRides, availability, assignedRideId}}
- commuters: {commuterId: {name, phone, currentLocation, ongoingRideId}}

Real-time Listeners:
- Commuter: Listens to ride request status changes for specific ride
- Driver: Listens to incoming ride requests for specific driver
- Location updates for both roles with automatic Firebase sync
