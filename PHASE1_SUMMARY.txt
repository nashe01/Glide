Glide - Phase 1 Summary

What we have done so far
- Splash screen: MainActivity shows activity_splash and navigates after ~1.5s
- Onboarding flow: OnboardingActivity with 3 screens (activity_onboarding1/2/3); Skip/Get Started go to Login
- Authentication screens:
  - LoginActivity -> activity_login (links to Signup and Forgot Password)
  - SignupActivity -> activity_signup (back to Login)
  - ForgotPasswordActivity -> activity_forgot_password (basic input validation + mock toast)
- Navigation: Splash -> Onboarding -> Login -> (Signup / Forgot Password)
- Manifest: Activities registered (MainActivity, OnboardingActivity, LoginActivity, SignupActivity, ForgotPasswordActivity)
- UI: Edge-to-edge enabled across activities
