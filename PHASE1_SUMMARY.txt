   - Edge-to-edge enabled across all activities
   - Material UI components (TextInputLayout, MaterialButton)
   - Mock authentication (no Firebase)
   - Handler.postDelayed() for realistic network simulation
   - Toast messages for user feedback
   - Input validation and error handling

NOTES
=====
- All activities use phone-based authentication
- Navigation is fully functional with role-based routing
- UI follows Material Design principles
- Mock implementation ready for backend integration
- All screens are responsive and edge-to-edge enabled
- we will need to add form validation and proper Authentication
